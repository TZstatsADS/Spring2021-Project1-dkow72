### [Project Description](doc/)
Term: Spring 2021

+ Project title: An American Story of Income and Votes
+ This project is conducted by Daryl Kow

+ Project summary: An exploratory analysis into American voter patterns by income group which attempts to highlight how the GOP has experienced great success in gaining traction among various income groups in America, challenging some of the preconceived notions I had as an outsider of the American political system. The extent of the analysis is limited by the availability of data and the limitations of the data itself. Note that statistical assumptions had to be made to support certain data visualisations (e.g. normality assupmtion for the constructions of confidence intervals).
